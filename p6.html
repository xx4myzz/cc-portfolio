        <h2>reflection</h2>
        <p>The personal habit I was trying to track was my daily locations and recording which areas I frequented.</p>

        <p>I drew an abstract map of manhattan and had circles to represent the areas I found myself. The size of the circles represents the amount of time I spent at the areas.</p> 
            
        <p>To begin my sketch, I first listed out the areas I was in each day and the amount of time I spent to organize the locations and help me visualize.</p>
            
        <p>I learned that I spend a lot of time in areas not near where I live, but in areas that my friends were located in.</p>
