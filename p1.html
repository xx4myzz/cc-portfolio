      <h2>description from rin</h2>
      <p>Iâ€™ve lost my earphones before. It had a transparent sky blue color, had a bean like shape, with black straps and a buds. The end part of the cord had a shape to go over my ears.</p>

      <h2>reflection</h2>
      <p>The transparent sky blue color was hard for me to figure out how to code. I played around with blendMode but was too confused with how to use blendMode so I thought the default blendMode was the most representative.</p> 

      <p>The shape of earbuds are pretty standard so I felt like I had a good idea of what to create. I asked my partner further clarifying questions about whether the earbuds were wired or bluetooth and what was meant by the end part of the cord and shape to go over ears.</p> 
        
      <p>I searched for ways to create a bean shape in code but didn't really come up with anything. I also googled what a bean looked like because I was starting to doubt myself. The beans on google all looked pretty ovular so I decided to stick with the simple oval shape. Plus the black buds could block out the curve if there was one.</p>
        
      <p>For the wires, I started with straight lines. The image turned out a little weird since wires do not generally rest stick straight, so I opted for arcs instead. While trying to connect the arcs to the buds, I realized that one side of the buds needed to be shifted so that the lengths of wire to each bud were equal. This gave me the opportunity to use the translate() and push () / pop() lines of code which was really convenient since I did not have to manually move each piece of the bud.</p> 
        
      <p>The depiction of the image using code seemed unnecessarily lengthy to me. Needing to type out the exact coordinates and sizes of each piece seems excessive when visually drawing it out is simple. In the future, I hope to learn more about different ways to manipulate the code since the image still looks very simple. I also hope to be able to learn more about interactive designs and 3D designs.</p>
