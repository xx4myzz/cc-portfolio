        <p>This project turned out completely different from my original plan and my b and c plans. I thought I would do something with pigs, but I kept seeing Halloween decorations in stores which made me excited for spooky season. After deciding to do ghosts, I decided I wanted to do a jumpscare and imagined a larger, scarier ghost. To create the ghosts, I used circles, rectangles, arcs, and ellipses. At first, I gave the ghosts an orange backdrop. I also figured out how to download and use fonts since I wanted a spooky font for my "BOO" text. I wanted to use the mousePressed function for my jumpscare but could not figure out how to make it work. I ended up using a little bit of R knowledge and created an if-else function instead.</p>

        <p>After finishing my draft, I read through the rubric and realized I needed to add random () and mousePressed () codes. So I had to imagine what else I could add. I thought of adding random shades of red blood splatters with mousePressed, but once again, I could not figure out how the function works. Eventually, I accepted that the background code in the draw function was essentially erasing anything my mousePressed coded.</p> 
            
        <p>To incorporate random, I decided to play around with the eyes of the jump scare ghost and accidentally made them flash red -- which was perfect. Next, I needed to figure out what  I could do with the mousePressed function. In class, my group changed backgrounds with mousePressed so I decided to keep things simple and use mousePressed for changing backgrounds. I wanted to stay with the Halloween theme so I experimented with the minimum and maximum random numbers for RGB colors to get random backgrounds in orange and red shades.</p>
            
        <p>This project was pretty fun and creative. I wish I was able to figure out how to add blood splatters when I click the mouse since that would've made the design more fun. I look forward to learning more about interactive coding.</p>
