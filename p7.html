        <h2>reflection</h2>
        <p>I really enjoyed creating this game. The code itself was not too hard to write since many of the objectives were similar. I used class a lot to create objects that the girl could collide with. My favorite part was creating and implementing the visuals for the game. Since the game is about a childhood love, I knew I wanted a sort of watercolor/crayon theme like children's book illustrations. I created most of the illustrations by hand using the Sketchbook app. The only imported images are the coin and medicine icons for the maze, which were from the free image library Pixabay. </p>
      
    
        <h2>the proposal / how to find scenes</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>This game starts off in a dreamy sort of world (scene 0). The player can use the arrow keys to move the character around and explore. If the character collides with hidden parameters, then the character will be transported to a new scene.</p>
            
        <p>The first scene occurs when the girl flies into the sky. She gets transported to a scene where she can catch shooting stars. After catching all the stars, she will be transported back to scene 0.</p>
            
        <p>Scene 2 occurs when the girl runs off the screen. She gets transported to a hazy maze. There is a hidden portal to transport out of the maze that she needs to find. She earns points by colliding with coins and loses points when colliding with STEM/medicine icons. This represents my career path while pre-med. When she gets close to the portal, the portal will appear and flash. When she enters the portal, she will be transported back to scene 0.</p>
            
        <p>Scene 3 occurs when the girl runs into the clover. She gets transported to a hazy arena where she has to avoid bad/"unlucky" symbols and get "lucky" symbols. If she collides with bad symbols, she will lose a life, and if she collides with good symbols, she will gain a life. If she loses all her lives, she will be transported back to scene 0.</p>
            
        <p>Scene 4 occurs when she collides with the puppy. She will be transported into a cute dog park where she can pet dogs that are near through mouse clicks. There is no way out since I could not think of a reason to leave the scene.</p>
            
        <p>Scene 5 occurs when the girl gets into bed. She will be transported to a scene where she is trying to fall asleep by counting sheep. After she finishes counting, she will "fall asleep". She will find herself back at scene 0 and realize that she was in a dream world all along.</p> 
            
        <p>I thought of creating a dream world game since as I child I really loved sleeping, but I also found it hard to fall asleep. This game is a love note to sleep.</p>
