        <h2>reflection</h2>
        <p>This project was really fun as a concept but, in practice, really time-consuming. It got me really looking forward to learning more about how to simplify code.</p>

        <p>My three sketches were the butterfly life cycle, the fly life cycle, and growing out roots. I thought I would do the fly life cycle since it seemed easy, but when I started coding, I was more inclined to do the prettier aesthetics of a butterfly cycle. The clock is novel to me in that I knew of the cycle shallowly (I knew the order) but did not know the exact amount of time the butterfly spent at each stage.</p>
            
        <p>I started with the non-mobile: the light blue background, leaf, stem, egg, chryssalis. Then I added did a lil research about the butterfly life cycle to make the clock as proportionally accurate as possible. I used the average life cycles of a few different butterfly species, then scaled it to 30 second intervals so that my animation would cycle twice in 60 seconds.</p> 
            
        <p>I then used the if (second()) code to make the egg and chrysallis appear during the seconds that I had calculated. Next, I moved onto the caterpillar. I had to code each component of the caterpillar separetely and keep adjusting so that they lined up without too much space or too much overlap. It took a while because there was a lot of adjusting small increments and waiting for the caterpillar part of the cycle to play. While watching the second loop, I realized the caterpillar's size and position weren't resetting so I had to play around with the code to fix it. Eventually I settled with an if() then() code to reset the caterpillar's size and position during the time it was not playing.</p> 
            
        <p>Next, I coded the butterfly. I created a non-moving butterfly and thought the clock was not very fun -- and also not very clock-like. So, I coded the circling sun to add more movement into my sketch. Since the sun was circling, I thought of sunrise and sunset and wanted to code a day/night transitioning background. I found fading code online from a fading text sketch and reworked it to do what I needed. I added a dark blue fading square across the whole canvas. Since I am not totally sure what the code exactly means, I couldn't make it perfectly fit my sketch. After a few loops, you can notice the day and night transitions do not match the circling sun.</p> 
            
        <p>Since my caterpillar moves, I was not satisfied with the immobile butterfly. Thus, I added random() to the wing shape size to and the body to make it look like the butterfly is fluttering.</p>
            
        <p>Overall, the end result of the project is really fun to watch, but I don't think it will alter the way I tell time. I am excited to learn more about simplifying the code / learning about ways that will make the code shorter since I had to individually code each line and shape and coordinate them.</p>
